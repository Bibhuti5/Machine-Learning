## Heart disease prediction
1. Heart disease describes a range of conditions that affect your heart. Diseases under the heart disease umbrella include blood vessel diseases, such as coronary artery disease, heart rhythm problems (arrhythmia) and heart defects you’re born with (congenital heart defects), among others. Heart disease is one of the biggest causes of morbidity and mortality among the population of the world. Prediction of cardiovascular disease is regarded as one of the most important subjects in the section of clinical data science. The amount of data in the healthcare industry is huge.

## Logistic Regression

We will use Naive Bayes to model the "Pima Indians Diabetes" data set. This model will predict which people are likely to develop diabetes.


This dataset is originally from the National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases. The objective of the dataset is to diagnostically predict whether or not a patient has diabetes, based on certain diagnostic measurements included in the dataset. Several constraints were placed on the selection of these instances from a larger database. In particular, all patients here are females at least 21 years old of Pima Indian heritage.

## Name Enity Recognition

Named Entity means anything that is a real-world object such as a person, a place, any organisation, any product which has a name. For example – “My name is Bibhti, and I and a Machine Learning Trainer”. In this sentence the name “Bibhuti”, the field or subject “Machine Learning” and the profession “Trainer” are named entities.
 
In Machine Learning Named Entity Recognition (NER) is a task of Natural Language Processing to identify the named entities in a certain piece of text.

Have you ever used software known as Grammarly? It identifies all the incorrect spellings and punctuations in the text and corrects it. But it does not do anything with the named entities, as it is also using the same technique. In this article, I will take you through the task of Named Entity Recognition (NER) with Machine Learning.

### Loading the Data for Named Entity Recognition (NER)
The dataset, that I will use for this task can be easily downloaded from  https://github.com/amankharwal/Website-data/blob/master/ner_dataset.csv 
. Now the first thing I will fo is to load the data and have a look at it to know what I am working with. So let’s simply import the pandas library and load the data:
